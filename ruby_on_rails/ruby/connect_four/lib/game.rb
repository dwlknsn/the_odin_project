      Welcome to Connect Four!
      The goal of the game is to be the first player to get four of your pieces in a row.
      The board is 6 rows high and 7 columns wide.
      The first player to go will be Player 1.
      The players will alternate turns.
      The first player to get four of their pieces in a row wins!
      If the board is full and no player has won, the game is a draw.

      Player 1 will be using #{player_1.marker}
      Player 2 will be using #{player_2.marker}

      GOOD LUCK!
